## What is this?

[[Meta/Team/Alexander|I]] suggest to organize information on concept of [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/#what-is-digital-gardening).

For online collaboration, I believe, the [[Meta/Google Docs/Working Google Docs|Google Docs]]  is the best tool and **no make sense to look for something else**. But for final thoughts, for publishing would be great to have somethings more structured. This site is a first attempt to do archive this.  

Principles I would like to put to the basis of information organization:

* **Portability**. Store content as a [plain text](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+your+first+note) in [opened formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) without any vendor-lock on tool to edit or publish content.
* [[playground/CJK + Latex Support (æµ‹è¯•)|CJK and LaTex Support]]
* **Graph view** for the content.
* **Search** by content/tags.
* **History of changes** on top of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (as a best free tool for content change management).
* **Publish** content in a fancy view.
 

There are a lot of different [ðŸª´ gardening tools](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). Personally, I'm using [[Meta/Tools/Obsidian|Obsidian]]. It supports [Obsidian Publish](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Set+up+Obsidian+Publish) and free [desktop](https://obsidian.md/) and [mobile apps](https://obsidian.md/mobile).

[Obsidian Publish](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Set+up+Obsidian+Publish) looks great (Nice [example](https://publish.obsidian.md/shellcommands/Index) or it [own](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) documentation) but it's [not free](https://obsidian.md/pricing) and I didn't manged how to publish it from [GitHub](https://github.com/art-ws/wann-dg/actions) automatically on content change. 

So, I did review of the [existing tools](https://beingpax.medium.com/7-obsidian-publish-alternatives-to-publish-your-notes-online-for-free-33db4fb06f5), took [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) as a basis and bit improved it to look and feel more close to original Obsidian Publish. 

On long term, I think, better to go with the Obsidian Publish - it's more scalable and fully functional.

## What the next?

I created [GitHub repository](https://github.com/art-ws/wann-dg) with content examples (See [[Meta/WaNN generic|WaNN generic]] , [[Drafts/Modeling|Modeling]]) and published it on my own site as a "**proof-of-concept**" for review. If you like the idea, then make sense to create a dedicated GitHub repository controlled by [company](https://artificialneuralcomputing.com/) and publish it content on some domain (Ex.: `https://wann.artificialneuralcomputing.com`)
