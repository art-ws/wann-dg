{"/":{"title":"The World as a Neural Network","content":"\n## What is this?\n\n[[Meta/Team/Alexander|I]] suggest to organize information on concept of [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/#what-is-digital-gardening).\n\nFor online collaboration, I believe, the [[Meta/Google Docs/Working Google Docs|Google Docs]]  is the best tool and **no make sense to look for something else**. But for final thoughts, for publishing would be great to have somethings more structured. This site is a first attempt to do archive this.  \n\nPrinciples I would like to put to the basis of information organization:\n\n* **Portability**. Store content as a [plain text](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+your+first+note) in [opened formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) without any vendor-lock on tool to edit or publish content.\n* [[playground/CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)|CJK and LaTex Support]]\n* **Graph view** for the content.\n* **Search** by content/tags.\n* **History of changes** on top of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (as a best free tool for content change management).\n* **Publish** content in a fancy view.\n \n\nThere are a lot of different [ü™¥ gardening tools](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). Personally, I'm using [[Meta/Tools/Obsidian|Obsidian]]. It supports [Obsidian Publish](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Set+up+Obsidian+Publish) and free [desktop](https://obsidian.md/) and [mobile apps](https://obsidian.md/mobile).\n\n[Obsidian Publish](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Set+up+Obsidian+Publish) looks great (Nice [example](https://publish.obsidian.md/shellcommands/Index) or it [own](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) documentation) but it's [not free](https://obsidian.md/pricing) and I didn't manged how to publish it from [GitHub](https://github.com/art-ws/wann-dg/actions) automatically on content change. \n\nSo, I did review of the [existing tools](https://beingpax.medium.com/7-obsidian-publish-alternatives-to-publish-your-notes-online-for-free-33db4fb06f5), took [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) as a basis and bit improved it to look and feel more close to original Obsidian Publish. \n\nOn long term, I think, better to go with the Obsidian Publish - it's more scalable and fully functional.\n\n## What the next?\n\nI created [GitHub repository](https://github.com/art-ws/wann-dg) with content examples (See [[Meta/WaNN generic|WaNN generic]] , [[Drafts/Modeling|Modeling]]) and published it on my own site as a \"**proof-of-concept**\" for review. If you like the idea, then make sense to create a dedicated GitHub repository controlled by [company](https://artificialneuralcomputing.com/) and publish it content on some domain (Ex.: `https://wann.artificialneuralcomputing.com`)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":[]},"/Drafts/Modeling":{"title":"Modeling","content":"\nAuthor: [[Meta/Team/Victor|Victor]]\n\n## What is modeling?\n\n\u003e Modeling, in a general sense, refers to the process of creating a representation or abstraction of a real-world system, concept, or phenomenon. It involves constructing a simplified version of the system or concept that captures its essential features and behaviors.\n\n\u003e In various fields such as science, engineering, statistics, and computer science, modeling plays a crucial role in understanding, analyzing, and predicting complex systems. Models can be mathematical, physical, conceptual, or computational, depending on the nature of the system being studied and the purpose of the model.\n\n\u003e We are mostly interested in mathematical modeling. It involves using mathematical equations and formulas to describe the relationships and interactions between different variables in a system. This approach often employs mathematical tools such as differential equations, probability theory, optimization techniques, and statistical methods.\n\n*By [[Meta/Team/ChatGPT|ChatGPT]]*\n\n## What is a mathematical model ?\n\nMathematical model is usually a [[Terms/Dynamical system|dynamical system]] which consists of *variables* (changeable, non-constant numbers) and some *equations* (rules)  under which they perform some evolution.\n\nTo use the model, scientists have to create a bridge between abstract mathematical objects and the real world; _variables _(or functions of them) are_ _matching with the numbers that can be observed in experiments using some measuring devices (coordinates, velocities, voltages, time intervals, pressures, temperatures etc). The quality of the model can then be defined as ‚Äúhow close are such values that we get as a calculation from our theory (model) and as measurement in the experiment.‚Äù\n\n\n\n## Models hierarchy\n\nAs we add more features of some phenomenon in consideration the model becomes more precise and more complex. One requirement for a _better _model_ _is to include the previous ( _simpler_ ) model as a special limit where newly considered effects are negligible. \n\nOne classic example is Classical (Newtonian) Mechanics and Special Relativity: for bodies that move with the speed comparable to the speed of light it is no longer possible to describe their motion with Classical Mechanics. Fortunately Special Relativity appears to be able to describe both cases: when bodies move with significantly less velocity than light and with the velocity comparable to the speed of light; in the limit of small velocities both theories produce exactly the same results.\n\n\n\n## Mathematical model (framework) of an Artificial Neural Network\n\nIn general, any learning system is a dynamical system that consists of two types of variables: trainable and non-trainable. These two types differ in their dynamics. Non-trainable variables evolve according to some predefined rule (Activation dynamics). Trainable variables are adjusted in order to minimize loss function (Learning dynamics).\n\n[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIkGhGOnhAYBzbigTZAQcSe35k0bBeoTG_x8A3bhHrk/edit)","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["GoogleDocs"]},"/Meta/Google-Docs/ANC-Video-Series-Kick-Off-Brainstorming":{"title":"ANC Video Series: Kick-Off \u0026 Brainstorming","content":" \n[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vOxElBJnuhrYAnAbGG9I7QEofzPYymqfy3Jk0XuCDVc/edit#)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["GoogleDocs"]},"/Meta/Google-Docs/ANC-Video-Series-Quanta":{"title":"ANC Video Series Quanta","content":"[ANC: Video Series Quanta](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGs0IBQJGbKpVrXwWA_dnaKJX3rizcLeJMJZDg8cm4Q/edit)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":[]},"/Meta/Google-Docs/Working-Google-Docs":{"title":"Working Google Docs","content":"\n## Working Google Docs\n\n*  [[Meta/Google Docs/ANC Video Series Quanta|ANC Video Series Quanta]]\n* [[Meta/Google Docs/ANC Video Series Kick-Off \u0026 Brainstorming|ANC Video Series Kick-Off \u0026 Brainstorming]]\n* [[Meta/Google Docs/quantum-0|quantum-0]]\n* [[Meta/WaNN generic|WaNN generic]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":[]},"/Meta/Google-Docs/quantum-0":{"title":"quantum-0","content":"[quantum-0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2bWeTM9BipAGFCs70W7bECLZEdRf77QyCGT0VWdkQk/edit)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":[]},"/Meta/Team/Alexander":{"title":"Alexander","content":"\n## Alexander\n\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \nComputer Science, IT \n\n[[_index|About this site]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Team/Artem":{"title":"Artem","content":"\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \n[[Terms/WaNN|WaNN]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Team/ChatGPT":{"title":"ChatGPT","content":"https://chat.openai.com/","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":[]},"/Meta/Team/Josh":{"title":"Josh","content":"\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \nTechnical Management, Project Management","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Team/Katya":{"title":"Katya","content":"\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \nComputer Science, IT, People Management","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Team/Oleksandr":{"title":"Oleksandr","content":"\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \nMath","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Team/Revel":{"title":"Revel","content":"\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \nPsychology","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Team/Team":{"title":"Team","content":"\n| Team Member | Background / Specialty | \n| ---------- | --------- | \n| [[Meta/Team/Vitaly]]    | [[Terms/WaNN]] | \n| [[Meta/Team/Artem]]     | [[Terms/WaNN]] |\n| [[Meta/Team/Victoria]]  | Science \u0026 Math, Video Editing, Creative Design |\n| [[Meta/Team/Katya]]     | Computer Science, IT, People Management |\n| [[Meta/Team/Alexander]] | Computer Science, IT |\n| [[Meta/Team/Victor]]    | Math, IT |\n| [[Meta/Team/Josh]]      | Technical Management, Project Management  |\n| [[Meta/Team/Revel]]     | Psychology |\n| [[Meta/Team/Oleksandr]] |  Math |\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":[]},"/Meta/Team/Victor":{"title":"Victor","content":"\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \nMath, IT","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Team/Victoria":{"title":"Victoria","content":"\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \nScience \u0026 Math, Video Editing, Creative Design","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Team/Vitaly":{"title":"Vitaly","content":"\n## Background / Specialty\n\n[[Meta/Team/Team|Team]] \n[[Terms/WaNN|WaNN]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Meta/Team"]},"/Meta/Tools/Docs-to-Markdown":{"title":"Docs to Markdown","content":"\nUseful tool to convert Google doc to markdown: [Docs to Markdown](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Tool"]},"/Meta/Tools/Obsidian":{"title":"Obsidian","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-15T18:31:35.276227616Z","tags":["Tool"]},"/Meta/WaNN-generic":{"title":"WaNN generic","content":"\n[[Terms/WaNN|WaNN]] conspect.\n\n## NN at a particular scale\n\n* Trainable and non-trainable variables\n* Particular [[Terms/NN/Loss function|loss function]]\n* Learns and improves its abilities.\n* NN is developing models\n\t* Learning of Distributions, Bayesian Learning\n\t\t* [[Terms/NN/Environment|Environment]]\n\t\t* Model of Self -
